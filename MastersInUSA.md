### Job/Internship in USA
----
- Universities in the US are not responsible for getting you a job. This is true for any university be it Harvard or UB.
- Your undergraduate/graduate program helps you get a good job through its curriculum. So make sure you choose a university that helps you achieve your dream role.

##### ðŸ“Œ How to apply to jobs/internship?
This process begins 6 to 9 months in advance. Let's say you will join a university and start your Masters in CS* during Fall 2022 (i.e. Aug 2022). According to my knowledge and the visa restrictions, you need to be present in US for at least 2 semesters in order to start working full-time on CPT*.  So that means you are looking to intern during Summer 2023 (i.e. May 2023). This means you should start **acitvely** applying by October 2022.
If you are graduating in Feb 2024, then you should start **acitvely** looking for jobs by Aug 2023.

Ways to apply for job/internships
- Referrals: Seek referrals from UB alumni or strangers on LinkedIn.
- Cold Applications: Apply to the careers page of the company. Eg: Simply google Github careers and the first few links will direct you to the official Github careers website with all the openings they have.
- Career Fair: You can attend many career fairs that are organized annually, and reach out to the recruiters at these career fairs for employment.
- Recruiters and Hiring Managers (HRMs): Send cold connection request on LinkedIn to recruiters and hrms and let them know what you are looking for.
- Networking: Makes genuine connections, where people would be happy to help you. I got 5 offers because of my networking skills.

##### ðŸ“Œ Can I get a job without any relevant experience?
Short answer: YES </br>
Long answer: Newgrads* should apply to "NewGrad" job applications. Usually the interview process is simpler for a newgrad, and the interviewer is aware that you are a newgrad, so they will ask you questions from your Resume, courses you studied, and DS* and Algo* LC* questions (for CS students), for non-CS students, questions will be asked depending on your domain. For eg: DS newgrads are asked to solve case studies.

##### ðŸ“Œ Can I get a job without any internship experience?
Short answer: YES </br>
Long answer: Truth be told, getting an internship is harder than getting a job. True story! So even if you do not get an internship, don't be disheartened. You can utilize your Summer time to join a bootcamp, help a professor in their research/project, do an unpaid internship, build your own project, study an additional course useful to your curriculum to reduce you course load in the end semester, network, or simply practice LC questions. I can assure you, that I have many friends who did not get an internship during the summer, but they got great jobs after their graduation!ðŸ˜‡

##### ðŸ“Œ Is it difficult to get a job in the US?
Short answer: Maybe </br>
Long answer: As a non-immigrant, yes it can be a little difficult to get a job in the US. But not impossible at all! There is definitely a lot of hardwork involved, so be prepared for that! You will have to submit 100s of applications. I submitted 400+ applications to get 1 internship offer. I submitted 1000+ applications to get 5 job offers. So you get the gist. Along with your job search you also have to maneuver your studies, part-time job (if you have one), prepare for your interviews, and also do all household chores, which can be overwhelming. But you will get the hang of it after the first semester. Everyone does!

##### ðŸ“Œ Most workplaces are coming back to normal from WFH*, will it affect the search for job/internships in USA?
Short answer: Mostly No </br>
Long answer: Most companies are using a hybrid module which means that employees would work at the office certain days, and work from home the other days of the week. This is all subjective to the company. However, for internships, companies might offer the students to be on the office campus, since that will give you a better experience of the company and its culture. Till now (April 2022), all interviews are still being conducted remotely. Before COVID-19 companies would traditionally fly you out to visit their HQ* office and do an in-person onsite round. This has changed post COVID-19, and companies now conduct virtual onsite interviews via Zoom/Meets/Teams. Additionally, many companies have opened up to remote internships so there is definitely a lot of opportunities out there. The location barrier _in my opinion_ is no more.

##### ðŸ“Œ What is the salary offered to a NewGrad/SDE?
Range: $65,000 - $140,000 </br>
Median: $110,000 [source Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/us-software-developer-salary-SRCH_IL.0,2_IN1_KO3,21.htm?clickSource=searchBtn)
 
##### ðŸ“Œ What is the salary offered to a Data Scientist?
Note: Do a quick google search and you will find the range for a role relevant to you. I find these websites very useful for such research: 
* [Levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/2021/)
* [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/us-data-scientist-salary-SRCH_IL.0,2_IN1_KO3,17.htm)

##### ðŸ“Œ Which career fairs to attend to get job oppportunities?
* [Grace Hopper Celebration (GHC)](https://ghc.anitab.org/) - anyone can attend
* [Society of Women Engineers (SWE)](https://swe.org/) - anyone can attend
* [National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE)](https://www.nsbe.org/) - anyone can attend
* [TAPIA](https://tapiaconference.cmd-it.org/) - anyone can attend

##### ðŸ“Œ Can I get a job in AI/ML?
Short answer: Maybe </br>
Long answer: As per my experience, since AI/ML is still a very research oriented field, getting interviews for AI/ML roles is quite a challenge. Unless you already have an impressive experience in AI/ML or you do research in AI/ML it will be a challenge to get callbacks. While the job description eligibility says Masters or Ph.D. candidate, the companies usually prefer a Ph.D. candidate. This is what usually I have observed.

##### ðŸ“Œ Can I get my internship converted to a FTE*?
Short answer: YES </br>
Long answer: During you internship make sure you are in good terms with your manager as they will be responsible for extending you the FTE offer. Work hard and network with employees of that company even harder. Pick up tasks that no one on the team is willing to do and deliver the output. Keep your video always on if working remotely, even if no one else's video is on. Make sure your work gets the visibility it deserves. Keep high level of professionalism (i.e be punctual, be present, be polite, be helpful). Ask questions to understand the systems you are working on. Deep dive and keep your confidence alive. Don't forget to have some fun too!

##### ðŸ“Œ Does past experience from another country count?
Short answer: Maybe </br>
Long Answer: It depends a lot on the experience you have had. If you have 2-3 yrs of experience then most likely you should aim for entry level jobs. If you plan to aim for senior level jobs, then keep in mind that the bar for these roles is quite high, and clearing the interviews equally challenging. Additonally, even if you over achieve and clear the interview somehow, sustaining a senior role can be quite challenging and overwhelming as the learning curve is very steep and inability to fullfill the requirements can lead to layoff. However, if you have 4-5 yrs of experience then you should aim for senior level jobs. Depsite these suggestions if you feel confident you will be able to fullfill the duties for the role, then definitely pursue your dream role!

##### ðŸ“Œ Are there enough jobs for my role?
Here is how YOU can find this out and get a ballpark number. Go to LinkedIn -> Click on Jobs tab -> in the search bar type the role you aim for. You will see LinkedIn showing you a number representing the number of jobs currently available. So that many job opportunities are already open for the role you are thinking of applying and you need only 1 job to start your career! Ofcourse there might be other companies out there who do not post there jobs on LinkedIn and those options are open for you too!
I did a quick search for an [Environmental Engineer jobs in the US](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?keywords=environmental%20engineer) and there are 27,680 jobs for Environmental Engineer at this time (April 2022). 


### Resume and Interviews
---
##### ðŸ“Œ What the interview proces to hire an SDE*?
The hiring and interview process is different in the US. The process is as such (for CS graduates, SDE roles):

* You apply to ~100+ applications. OR you network with people
* Your resume gets shortlisted
* You receive an OA* (Online Assessment)
* You receive a 15-30 min call with a recruiter. They talk about your resume, salary expectations, interview process etc.
* You may also receive a hiring manager call. Similar to recruiters call.
* You receive 1st Phone Interview (coding round)
* You receive 2nd Phone Interview (coding round)(not always)
* You receive final Onsite Interview (coding + behavioural + design) This interview is 4-6 hours long.
* You receive a recuiters call. If everything goes well, you are hired.

Each interview is based on CS fundamentals.
*Sometimes you also receive a take home project, and you are assessed on that.


### Networking (Give first, take later)
----
##### ðŸ“Œ How to network with strangers on LinkedIn?
* Understand this, before you seek a favour, you will have to do a favour in order to build a genuine network connection. If you are kind and helpful to others, the same will be reciprocated to you.
* Add people who matter to your career. They can be people you look upto, or people who share good content. Add people who are already working at your dream role. Add people from your dream company. Add people from your ex-university, ex-company. Add people whom you have met in conferences.
* Offer to help first. For eg: If I am adding a software developer at Netfix, then I can offer my help as: "Hey, I saw on your profile you are looking for a switch in front-end, I saw this opening at Google, and this might interest you!". While it may not be the role the person is looking for, they will understand and appreciate your gesture.
* Don't get disheartened if you do not get a response. Trust me, I have been on both ends. As a student, I have sent connections to many people and never heard back from them. But I understand that when people are working and happy with their jobs, they tend to use LinkedIn less. Or people might have other things to juggle with their work, or their work is hectic, and hence their connection backlog piles up. So be okay with not getting a response, people are genuinely busy. There are other fishes in the sea, look elsewhere.
* Be professional. Address them by name. Not sir/ma'am/sister/bro. Their name, and SPELL it right! Also, don't just start asking questions without greeting. At the same time, don't just say 'Hi' and leave the conversation in between. 
* Follow the follow-up rule. After sending a connection a message, if you are not getting a response, 1st follow-up after 7 days, 2nd follow-up after 3 days, 3rd and final follow-up after 2 days. If you don't get a response after the final follow up, consider the lead as ghosted and look for someone else. This is very important when you asks for referrals!
* For more help on networking join my slack channel. I share examples there and help people network.


##### ðŸ“Œ How to network with recruiters/HRMs?
Recruiters: Search for recruiters using LinkedIn, and send a connection request with a personalized note. Mention what you are looking for, add your resume link, job id, and job link. You have a 300 character limit, so make use of every character and draft a customized note for every recruiter. I share examples and help students to connect with recruiters, so feel free to join the slack channel. </br>
HRMs: Serach for "I'm hiring" posts on LinkedIn. Reach out to HRMs in a similar way as you would reach out the recruiters. As per my experience HRMs accept connection request more often than recruiters (this is my personal observation). Once they accept your request, firstly, thank them for accpeting the request, then inform them why you will be a good fit for the role and the company. Make sure to follow-up.

##### ðŸ“Œ Does LinkedIn profile matter?
Short answer: 100% YES </br>
Long answer: The first thing a recruiter, hiring manager, or even an interviewer does is checkout your LinkedIn profile. So make sure it is upto date. In the heading mention what you are looking for. Do not have a selfie profile picture. Have a background image. Keep 'open to work' option enabled. Keep your 'about' section update and summarize your experience, add all your experiences and the impactful work you have done so far. Add all the relevant certifications. Ask your friends, colleague, managers to endorse you for the technologies. Ask your previous manager to write recommendations for you. Complete your profile as much as you. It is your career history and it should be updated to look professional and also appear in other people's searches. 


### Student life in USA
----
##### ðŸ“Œ How to manage time  as a student?
I will not sugar coat, **life as a student is hard.** So first accept the reality and be mentally prepared to work your ass off! </br>
* You need to firstly focus on your mental/physical health. So eat well, sleep well, and do something fun to not lose your sanity. If anything happens to your health, then you lose out on your studies which will be a very heavy price to pay and quite difficult to overcome the backlog of tasks that pile up for you. 
* Next priority is to focus on your studies. Before attending your class for that day, make sure you have self-studied the chapter, jotted down your notes and are aware of what you will learn today in the class. Do not miss your classes (unless you have not self-studied). You will think you can make up later, but there is always so much to do, that your backlog of tasks will keep piling up. So stay with the class.
* Start your assignments early. Don't take the assignments lightly. They are all brain sctrachers, and you cannot do them in the last moment. So always start on the projects/assignment ASAP. 
* Keep a study schedule and try to stick to it.
* During internship/job hunting things can get tricky. Try to be organized and set time specific to each task. For eg: start your day by submitting  10 application, then work on your assignments for a bit, if you get stuck change the subject, then take a break, do some competetive programming questions(LC questions), and finally study for your next day classes and wrap up your day.
* For household chores try to use divide and conquer approach. Share the responsibilities and help each other out. Having harmonious roommates really helps!
* If cooking becomes an issue for you, then stock up your refrigerator by cooking the meals in advance and storing them in the freezer to last longer.

##### ðŸ“Œ  What are the some mistake students often do?
* Not study regularly: US Education system is designed for consistent workers rather than last-minute workers. Make sure you give 2hrs a day to each subject.
* Plagiarise or cheat: ***DO NOT COPY your assignment from someone else.*** You may think you are clever and will manage not getting caught, but you cannot fool a professor with a plagiarism checker software. Every university is **very strict** when it comes to cheating. It is better to get a zero(0) than **>F<** which will haunt you all your life. _**Your visa status can be revoked from the USA.**_ Here is an example to academic integrity rules for my department at my univeristy: [CSE AI rules listed here](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering/information-for-students/policies/academic-integrity.html)
* Low class attendance: I have observed from my personal experience that attending classes is only useful if you have self-studied the night before what is going to be taught in class. So make sure to brush up on the presentation slide or class notes before the lecture day. This will help you understand what the professor is teaching and also ask doubts in the class. Attending class without self-study is useless and in that case, skip the class and first self-study.
* Don't attend TA Sessions: When in doubt, instead of asking your friend to teach you the topic, go to the TA session to get your doubt cleared. It is 100% better. Your understanding will be proper and complete.
* Don't participate in extracurricular activities. All work and no play makes jack a dull boy. Interacting and networking will keep you aware of many things that happen at your university. So step up your game and try to interact with many people and with various types of people. Join clubs and do group activities. 
* Don't stay in touch with your seniors: Make geunine connections with your seniors. They can be your potential mentors and guide you really well!
* Not work on your resume: Your resume is the most important step in getting you the job. Focus on building a great resume for yourself.
* Compare yourself to others: This is something students do inherently. Your journey is unique. Not everyone has the same experience as you have. So make sure to remind yourself to never compare yourself with anyone else's success or failure.

##### ðŸ“Œ Should I do a part-time job on campus?
Short answer: Maybe
Long answer: Choose to do part-time job very thoughtfully. Don't just jump into the idea, because everyone else around you is doing that. Your first priority is to complete your higher studies, learn a bunch of stuff through the courses you opt, and get decent GPA. If doing a part-time will affect your learning then don't do part-time job. If it will not affect your learning, then go for it. Don't do part-time job for money. If you don't give time to studies and prepare for interviews because of your part-time, then it is all a waste. No point in earning a few thousand dollars when your aim is to get employed with a 6-figure salary.
