### Job/Internship in USA
----
- Universities in the US are not responsible for getting you a job. This is true for any university be it Harvard or UB.
- Your undergraduate/graduate program helps you get a good job through its curriculum. So make sure you choose a university that helps you achieve your dream role.

##### ðŸ“Œ How to apply to jobs/internship?
This process begins 6 to 9 months in advance. Let's say you will join a university and start your Masters in CS during Fall 2022 (i.e. Aug 2022). According to my knowledge and the visa restrictions, you need to be present in US for at least 2 semesters in order to start working full-time on CPT*.  So that means you are looking to intern during Summer 2023 (i.e. May 2023). This means you should start **acitvely** applying by October 2022.
If you are graduating in Feb 2024, then you should start **acitvely** looking for jobs by Aug 2023.

Ways to apply for job/internships
- Referrals: Seek referrals from UB alumni or strangers on LinkedIn.
- Cold Applications: Apply to the careers page of the company. Eg: Simply Google Github careers and the first few links will direct you to the official Github careers website with all the openings they have.
- Career Fair: You can attend many career fairs that are organized annually, and reach out to the recruiters at these career fairs for employment.
- Recruiters and Hiring Managers (HRMs): Send cold connection request on LinkedIn to recruiters and hrms and let them know what you are looking for.
- Networking: Makes genuine connections, where people would be happy to help you. I got 5 offers because of my networking skills.

##### ðŸ“Œ Can I get a job without any relevant experience?
Short answer: YES
Long answer: Newgrads* should apply to "NewGrad" job applications. Usually the interview process is simpler for a newgrad, and the interviewer is aware that you are a newgrad, so they will ask you questions from your Resume, courses you studied, and DS* and Algo* LC* questions (for CS students), for non-CS students, questions will be asked depending on your domain. For eg: DS newgrads are asked to solve case studies.

##### ðŸ“Œ Can I get a job without any internship experience?
Short answer: YES
Long answer: Truth be told, getting an internship is harder than getting a job. True story! So even if you do not get an internship, don't be disheartened. You can utilize your Summer time to join a bootcamp, help a professor in their research/project, build your own project, study an additional course useful to your curriculum to reduce you course load in the end semester, network, or simply practice LC questions. I can assure you, that I have many friends who did not get an internship during the summer, but they got great jobs after their graduation!ðŸ˜‡
